# airbnb-nyc-price-prediction
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict the price of Airbnb listings in New York City. Using the publicly available Airbnb NYC Listings dataset, the objective is to build a regression model that can estimate the price of a listing based on a variety of features, including location, room type, number of reviews, availability, and other listing-specific attributes. The target variable for this task is the price, making it a supervised learning problem—specifically a regression problem, as the output is a continuous numerical value.

The initial features selected for modeling include neighbourhood_group, neighbourhood, room_type, minimum_nights, number_of_reviews, reviews_per_month, calculated_host_listings_count, and availability_365. These features may be refined or expanded as data exploration and feature engineering progress. The motivation behind this project is to provide a tool that can help Airbnb hosts set competitive and fair prices for their listings. For the Airbnb platform itself, such a model could be integrated to provide automated pricing recommendations, which could lead to improved occupancy rates, increased host revenue, and better customer satisfaction.

The project is implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebooks for development and analysis. Libraries such as Pandas and NumPy are used for data manipulation, while Matplotlib and Seaborn are used for visualization. Scikit-learn is employed for building and evaluating the regression models. The machine learning workflow includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, train-test splitting, model training, and performance evaluation using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R².

To run the project locally, users can clone the repository, set up a virtual environment, install the required dependencies from the requirements.txt file, and launch the notebook in Jupyter. Future improvements may include the use of more advanced models such as XGBoost or Gradient Boosting Regressors, hyperparameter tuning, and the deployment of the model through a web-based interface using tools like Streamlit or Flask. Visual enhancements such as interactive maps or dashboards may also be added.
